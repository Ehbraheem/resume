        <h2>Software Engineer:
          <small>Creating engaging solutions that help businesses be more efficient and easily reach their target
            audience.</small>
        </h2>
        <p>I am a software development with 6+ years of experience, and I am seeking new opportunities in the field of
          project management.
          I am a detailed and caring professional.
          First, 2016 in Lagos, I was involved in the development of a financial platform (SMEBoutique) that has helped
          businesses by providing access to low-cost and flexible loans to help them scale.
          Secondly, I built a caching system on top of Google Places service for my students at Andela Learning
          Community in Lagos, 2017.
          Lastly, last year, me alongside other members of my team at CraftTurf piloted Elephant, an Healthcare service
          provider that has presence in Kenya, Lebanon, and Syria.</p>
        <p>I am skilled in computer programming, software architecture, web architecture, and web development.</p>

          <p>This is the homepage for Elephant Healthcare, a digital platform that enables an intelligent, co-ordinated,
            and patient-centred service. Elephant Healthcare was piloted by me and my team at CraftTurf in 2019 for
            an organisation with the same name that is headquatered in London, United Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>The most interesting thing about Elephant Healthcare is its ease of use for frontline professionals.
            By the end of 2019, Elephant had helped over 200,000 people get the right healthcare service in Middle East
            and Africa.
            I am thrilled about this application and its impact on peoples lifes from the war zone of Lebanon and Syria,
            to the remote areas of Kenya.

            <p>This is the logo for SMEBoutique, a financial application that I co-built for Addosser Micro-Finance Bank
              in Lagos, 2016.</p>
            <p>This application that I co-created is engaging and user friendly. It has empowered over 1000+ businesses
              with flexible
              repayment loans to help boost their reach. I am very excited about SMEBoutique and its impact on small and medium scale enterprises.
